                            My main experience during this period was working on micro-services that used Spring Boot written in Kotlin + Arrow, following SOLID principles and TDD. Those practices were reflected delivering a robust, high quality product. I've worked with feature toggles, that helped to have Continuous Deployment.
                            Regarding soft skills, I've gained experience through pair programming, giving/receiving feedback and mentoring other people.
                            I was also part of the Tech Council, encouraging people to use new technologies reflected in ThoughtWorks Tech Radar. This experience gave me a broad vision of the different alternatives regarding technical tools.

(2017-2018)</strong><br/>The participation of women and non-binary people in local and national technical events is very low, and not at all representative of the diversity of existing professionals in the software industry. However, there is also a tendency for strictly technical and responsible jobs not to be filled by diverse professionals; causing a visibility issue.
