									Hello,<br/>
									I'm Noe Luaces, and among other things, I'm a software engineer by profession. <br/>
								The purpose of this personal website is sharing my experience and my personal/parallel projects that I've been working on through my career. <br/>
								In 2007, I finished my 3 year Bachelor Degree in Computer Science, but I always wanted to learn more of subjects that weren't included
								in my degree; so I enrolled a course to adapt my old degree to 4 year Bachelor Degree while working full time (don't recommend doing both things
									a the same time though). In that course I've learned about Software Architecture models and techniques, and also I was exposed to
									functional programming. <br/>
									I've also worked on initiatives to keep women developers in the industry, by offering them support that I know
									that is needed (by experience). The reason of that, it's the hostility that remains in some environments towards diverse people in general.
								</p>
								<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/about/holga.jpg" alt="Holga camera" /></span>
									I don't consider myself an expert in other areas, so I will say that I keep insisting on practicing some hobbies through all these years: like drawing, taking
									pictures with plastic cameras (with plastic lenses, like the one in the photo) or just with my phone, reading and accumulating comics (Japanese, Franco-Belgian
									or American indie comics), over-analysing indie movies and sometimes, criticising the mainstream ones. <br/>
									All of these things influence, some how, the rest of my work. I don't work as an illustrator, but I usually create my own drawings to use them in my blog posts. <br/>
									Another scenario is the one where I	use Monkey Island characters' names for mocking in a test, just to have an excuse to suggest to play that game,
									but only the first two parts.
