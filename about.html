									Hello,<br/>
									I'm Noe Luaces, and among other things, I'm a software engineer by profession. <br/>
								The purpose of this personal website is sharing my experience and my personal/parallel projects that I've been working on through my career. <br/>
								In 2007, I finished my 3 year Bachelor Degree in Computer Science, but I always wanted to learn more of subjects that weren't included
								in my degree; so I enrolled a course to adapt my old degree to 4 year Bachelor Degree while working full time (don't recommend doing both things
									a the same time though). <br/>
									I've also worked on initiatives to keep women developers in the industry, by offering them support that I know
									is needed by experience.
								</p>
								<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/about/holga.jpg" alt="Holga camera" /></span>
									I will say that I keep insisting on practicing some hobbies through all these years: like drawing, taking
									pictures with plastic cameras with plastic lenses (aka <a href="https://www.lomography.com/about">Lomography</a>) or just with my phone -overusing filters, of course-,
									reading and accumulating comics (Japanese, French, Belgian, Korean or American indie comics), over-analysing indie movies and sometimes, criticising the mainstream ones. <br/>
